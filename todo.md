# Future of the project

Since we already have a functional simple back-end, we can implement the following types

## Vectors

- [x] baseVector: general purpose vector **missin implementation for only real vector**
- [ ] zeroVector: all indexes are zero
- [ ] unitVector: all zeros, except 1 index
- [ ] scalarVector: all entries are the same value

## vector proxies
- [ ] range: accesor, view to the vector for contiguous elements
- [ ] slice: accesor, view to the vector for [un]contiguous elements

## matrices
- [x] matrices: **missing reshaping, adding cols and rows, and real type matrix**
- [x] zero matrix  **missing operations with zeroMatrix**
- [ ] identity
- [ ] scalar matrix, all entries have the same value
- [ ] triangular matrix(top,bottom), **won't implement**
- [ ] symmetric matrix **won't implement**
- [ ] hermitian matrix **won't implement**

## matrix proxies
- [ ] range 
- [ ] slice

## tensor
**Wont implement**
