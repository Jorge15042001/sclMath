Since we already have a functional simple back-end, we can implement the following types

## Vectors
[ ]vector : constant size 

**Probably better implement as fake classes**
[ ]zeroVector: all indexes are zero
[ ]unitVector: all zeros, except 1 index

## vector proxies
[ ]range: accesor, view to the vector for contiguous elements
[ ]slice: accesor, view to the vector for [un]contiguous elements
[ ]row:
[ ]col:

## matrices
[ ] matrices: missing reshaping, adding cols and rows
[ ] zero matrix 
[ ] identity
[ ] scalar matrix, all entries have the same value
[ ] triangular matrix(top,bottom), **won't implement**
[ ] symmetric matrix
[ ] hermitian matrix
## matrix proxies
[ ] range 
[ ] slice

## tensor
**Wont implement**
