This is the **s**imples **c**omplex **l**inear **Math**  library


The motivation for this library came from the programming drills from the book **"Quantum Computing for Computer scientist"**, in fact the set of examples is a numerical approach to solve the exercises from the *complex linear algebra* chapter of the book.

The main intention for this software is to be used as the mathematical backend for a *small Quantum Computer Simulator* [still in development](link), so most of the development resources will be focus in specific features required to that goal.

I have also taken inspiration from the design of the *Boost Basic Linear Algebra Library*, so if you are looking for fully-tested production level software solution, I recommend you use their library instead.

## Before diving in to the code

Be aware that this is by no mean production level software, although widely tested, is possible that some unknown bug may broke your code. 
Performance wasn't a big consideration while designing the code and there is no multithreading built in to the system, *if you want to contribute, this may be a good way to start*.
